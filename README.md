## Gameplay

This is a 2D snake-style game with a retro neon line aesthetic. Unlike classic Snake, the player-controlled snake is articulated and can rotate smoothly, allowing for more fluid movement.

The game features a responsive 16:10 aspect ratio canvas that scales to fit your browser window while maintaining proportional gameplay elements.

## How to Play

*   Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
*   Press Space to boost your speed.
*   Press M to mute/unmute.
*   Press Esc to pause.
*   Eat the food pellets to grow longer.
*   Avoid running into the walls or your own tail.
