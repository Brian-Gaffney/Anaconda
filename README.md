Anaconda is an attempt at porting the Anaconda minigame within [Timesplitters 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TimeSplitters_2 "Timesplitters 2")
 to HTML5 canvas


#Ideas:
	Multiplayer with web sockets
	Split into 2 snakes and independently control both (snake 1 = left right arrow, snake 2 = up down arrow?).
