Anaconda is an attempt at porting the Anaconda minigame from [Timesplitters 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TimeSplitters_2 "Timesplitters 2") - [(Video)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22thYhPCNw "Anaconda video")
 to HTML5 canvas


#Ideas:
	Multiplayer with web sockets
	Split into 2 snakes and independently control both (snake 1 = left right arrow, snake 2 = up down arrow?).
	Support TV with left/right split. Display each layer with a slight offset for 3D fun
